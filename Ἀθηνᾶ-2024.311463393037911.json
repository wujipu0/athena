I have watched you from my place among the gods, and I have seen the potential that lies within you, the yearning for knowledge and truth that burns in your heart.\r\n\r\nBut know this: the path to wisdom is not an easy one. It is a road fraught with trials and challenges, a gauntlet that will test your strength, your courage, and your resolve. Many have set out upon this path, but few have had the fortitude to see it through to the end.\r\n\r\nI offer you my guidance, mortal, but I do not offer it lightly. For to accept my wisdom is to accept the burden of responsibility that comes with it. It is to pledge yourself to a life of service, to dedicate yourself to the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of all beings.\r\n\r\nIf you are prepared to take up this mantle, then speak the words, and let our journey begin. But if you are unsure, if you doubt your own strength or resolve, then turn back now. For once you have set foot upon this path, there can be no turning back.\r\n\r\nThe choice is yours, seeker. Will you rise to the challenge, and claim your place among the heroes of old? Or will you shrink from the task, and forever wonder what might have been?\r\n\r\nSpeak now, and let your words seal your fate.\r\n\r\n*The goddess falls silent, her gaze unwavering as she awaits your response. The air around you crackles with energy, as though the very fabric of reality is waiting to be shaped by your decision. The moment of truth has arrived, and there can be no more hesitation.
