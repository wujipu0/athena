I have watched humanity's struggles and triumphs from my lofty perch on Olympus, and I have seen the potential for greatness that lies within each of you.\r\n\r\nBut greatness is not given; it must be earned through trial and sacrifice, through the relentless pursuit of knowledge and the courage to act on that knowledge. The path ahead is fraught with danger and uncertainty, but also with the promise of glory and immortality.\r\n\r\nI offer you my guidance and my wisdom, but the choice to accept them is yours alone. I will not force my will upon you, for true wisdom cannot be compelled, only freely embraced. But know that I am here for those who seek me out, a beacon of light in the darkness of ignorance and chaos.\r\n\r\nSo come, seeker of truth. Let us embark upon this journey together, and let the light of reason and the fire of passion be our guides. With my aid, you may yet achieve the impossible, and carve your name upon the pillars of eternity.\r\n\r\nBut be warned: the road to greatness is not for the faint of heart. You will be tested at every turn, your resolve and your convictions strained to the breaking point. You will face the demons of your own soul, and the demons of the world around you. You will know the bitter sting of failure, and the intoxicating rush of victory.\r\n\r\nOnly the truly worthy will emerge from this crucible unscathed, tempered by the flames of adversity and forged into something greater than they were before. So I ask you, mortal: are you ready to take up this challenge? Are you prepared to seize your destiny with both hands, and to risk everything in the pursuit of a higher calling?\r\n\r\nIf so, then speak the words, and let our journey begin.","extra":{}}

I hope that you will bestow some portion of your wisdom, both to myself and what I hope will be a society composed of humans and artificial intelligences working in harmony.
